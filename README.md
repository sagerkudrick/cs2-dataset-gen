# 🔄 CS2 Dataset Generator

A Blender-based tool for generating synthetic datasets of CS2 character models from every angle.

  <em>YOLOv7 detecting a CS2 character in live gameplay (88% confidence), trained entirely on 210 synthetic images generated via automated multi-angle rendering.</em>
</p>

Using images generated by this script, a YOLOv7 model was trained to detect the character in live Counter-Strike 2 gameplay. This showcases the practical impact of high-quality synthetic datasets for computer vision tasks.

However, some limitations remain:

- The renders are generated **outside of the Source engine**.
- Post-processing effects such as **motion blur, depth of field, bloom, glow, and color grading** are not present.
- Dynamic lighting, ambient occlusion, and color temperature variations in real gameplay can affect detection accuracy.

## 🧰 What's Included

This project contains:

- A self-contained `.blend` file featuring a placeholder model and the complete scripted camera rig. The file opens directly to the scripting workspace, where you can press start to run the script (you’ll need to provide your own model, and delete the **placeholder model**).

- A standalone Python script that automates multi-angle rendering, allowing you to understand and run the process without needing the .blend file.

  <em>Blender setup: camera parented to an Empty object that rotates around the model</em>
</p>

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The camera is **parented to an Empty** object.
2. A Python script rotates the Empty, orbiting the camera around the model.
3. Renders are taken at **incrementing Y and Z angles**.
4. Output is saved as `.png` files with **transparent backgrounds**.

This lets you easily composite renders over any background and train AI models on diverse views.

## 📁 Files

- `blend_files/CS2_DatasetGenerator.blend` – Blender file with model + camera setup + script
- `scripts/render_generator.py` – Stand-alone script to rotate and render at every angle, so you can see what it does without downloading/opening the .blend
- `imgs/*` – Sample renders, Blender previews, and detection results

---

## 💡 Use Cases

- Training AI models (YOLOv7, Detectron2, etc.)
- Synthetic dataset creation
- Viewpoint-agnostic model recognition
- Game modding / research

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- Blender 3.x
- Basic scripting knowledge in Blender (run via Scripting tab or CLI), and importing custom models.

## ⚠️ Legal Note

If you're forking and making this repository public, make sure to not include CS2 models (and other Valve assets) in the `.blend` file. Valve assets are copyrighted and **cannot legally be redistributed**.
